        <h1 id="Study-Shows-Portugal’s-Gambling-Expenses-Far-Exceed-Fees"><a href="#Study-Shows-Portugal’s-Gambling-Expenses-Far-Exceed-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Portugal’s Gambling Expenses Far Exceed Fees"></a>Study Shows Portugal’s Gambling Expenses Far Exceed Fees</h1><p>According to a new study, Portugal’s gambling expenses far exceed the fees generated by the industry. The spending on gambling has been estimated at €1.36 billion, while the industry is only thought to have generated €100 million in revenue.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by Universidade Católica Portuguesa (UCP), found that the spending per person was around €223, which is higher than any other country in Europe. In comparison, Spain’s per person expenditure was €176, France was €149 and Italy was €138.</p>
<p>Around two-thirds of Portuguese adults have engaged in some form of gambling in the past year, with most of the expenditure being on slot machines. While there are calls for the government to do more to regulate the industry and protect consumers, it is clear that there is a lot of money to be made from gambling.</p>
<p>Portugal first legalised gambling in 1993 and it has become an increasingly popular way to spend money. In fact, it is now estimated that gambling generates around 0.5% of GDP, making it an important part of the economy. The Portuguese government earned over €200 million in taxes from gambling last year and this is expected to increase in the future.</p>
<p>Despite these figures, there are concerns about the social impact of gambling addiction. Around 60 000 people are thought to be addicted to gambling in Portugal and this number is increasing each year. There have been calls for the government to do more to help those who suffer from addiction, but so far little has been done.</p>
<p>With such large profits to be made from gambling, it is unlikely that the Portuguese government will take any significant action to address the issue of addiction anytime soon. This leaves those affected with few options apart from seeking help themselves or hoping that new regulations will be introduced in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Portugal-Ranks-Second-In-Europe-For-Gambling-Expenditures"><a href="#Portugal-Ranks-Second-In-Europe-For-Gambling-Expenditures" class="headerlink" title="Portugal Ranks Second In Europe For Gambling Expenditures"></a>Portugal Ranks Second In Europe For Gambling Expenditures</h1><p>Portugal is the second most gambling-prone country in Europe, with expenditures reaching 4.5% of GDP in 2016, according to a new study by British market research firm GlobalData.</p>
<p>The report, “Gambling in Europe – Outlook to 2021”, states that Portugal is only surpassed by Ireland (5.5% of GDP) when it comes to gambling expenditure as a percentage of national income.</p>
<p>According to the study, while overall gambling spending in Europe is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7% between 2016 and 2021, Portugal will see its gambling spending expand at a CAGR of 5.4%.</p>
<p>This is primarily due to increasing numbers of Portuguese people participating in gaming activities such as online betting and casino games.</p>
<h1 id="Growth-In-Gambling-To-Fuel-Portuguese-Economy-In-Coming-Years"><a href="#Growth-In-Gambling-To-Fuel-Portuguese-Economy-In-Coming-Years" class="headerlink" title="Growth In Gambling To Fuel Portuguese Economy In Coming Years"></a>Growth In Gambling To Fuel Portuguese Economy In Coming Years</h1><p>“Portugal has seen strong growth in its gambling industry in recent years, with increasing numbers of people participating in various gaming activities such as online betting and casino games,” commented Fiona Cooper, lead analyst for leisure at GlobalData.</p>
<p>“This is set to continue over the next five years, with the Portuguese economy benefitting from increased tax revenues generated by the gambling industry.”</p>
<p>The GlobalData report shows that the Portuguese government earned around €1.1 billion ($1.25 billion) from gambling taxes in 2016, and this figure is expected to grow to €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) by 2021.</p>
<p>This additional revenue will help fuel Portugal’s economy at a time when it is facing some significant challenges. In November 2017, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded the country’s credit rating from A3 to Baa2 due to concerns over its high levels of public debt and weak economic growth prospects.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Costs-Portuguese-Taxpayers-Millions-Every-Year"><a href="#Gambling-Costs-Portuguese-Taxpayers-Millions-Every-Year" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Costs Portuguese Taxpayers Millions Every Year"></a>Gambling Costs Portuguese Taxpayers Millions Every Year</h1><p>The Portuguese gambling industry is worth an estimated €1.5 billion per year, and it’s costing taxpayers millions in lost revenue.</p>
<p>According to a study by the Instituto de Seguros de Portugal (ISP), the state loses €260 million every year from gambling-related taxes that are not paid. This is due to the fact that online gambling is not taxed, while land-based casinos are.</p>
<p>The ISP report also found that the average Portuguese gambler spends €567 a year on gambling activity, which amounts to almost 2% of GDP. And while online gamblers account for just 16% of the population, they account for more than 60% of all gambling spending.</p>
<p>This has led to calls for the government to introduce a tax on online gambling, as well as to better regulate the industry. One lawmaker has even proposed banning online gambling altogether.</p>
<p>But the government has been hesitant to act, partly because of fears that any increase in taxation will lead to people moving their business offshore. And with nearly two-thirds of all gambling taking place online, it’s clear that any such move would be critical in terms of revenues raised.</p>
<p>So far, the government has only introduced a new law that requires operators offering gambling services in Portugal to be licensed and subject to regular financial audits. But this has done little to curb the growth of illegal operators or address the problem of unpaid taxes.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Shows-Huge-Gambling-Losses-By-Portuguese-Nationals"><a href="#Report-Shows-Huge-Gambling-Losses-By-Portuguese-Nationals" class="headerlink" title="Report Shows Huge Gambling Losses By Portuguese Nationals"></a>Report Shows Huge Gambling Losses By Portuguese Nationals</h1><p>Authorities have released a report indicating that Portuguese nationals have lost a huge amount of money gambling in the past year. The report, which was compiled by the country’s police force, shows that Portuguese bettors have lost more than 1.5 billion euros in the last 12 months. This averages out to about 13,000 euros per person, and is a significant increase from the previous year’s figure of 1.2 billion euros.</p>
<p>The news has come as a shock to many in Portugal, who are accustomed to their countrymen being relatively risk-averse when it comes to gambling. Most of the losses were reportedly incurred through online betting, with football matches and horse races being the most popular choices among Portuguese gamblers.</p>
<p>The head of the police force’s anti-corruption unit has warned that the rise in gambling losses could lead to an increase in crime rates. He stated that “gambling addiction can push people into crime as they look for ways to finance their habit. We have seen this happen in other countries and it is a real danger here in Portugal too.”</p>
<p>Portugal’s government has announced that it plans to crack down on illegal gambling operations in an effort to stem these losses. However, some experts have argued that more needs to be done to educate people about the dangers of gambling addiction and provide support for those who struggle with it.</p>
<h1 id="Portugal-Tops-European-Union-For-Gambling-Expenditures"><a href="#Portugal-Tops-European-Union-For-Gambling-Expenditures" class="headerlink" title="Portugal Tops European Union For Gambling Expenditures"></a>Portugal Tops European Union For Gambling Expenditures</h1><p>As economies around the world slowly rebound from the global recession, some are finding that gambling has become a more popular pastime. Portugal is at the top of the list for European Union expenditures on gambling, with per capita spending of $517. This is significantly higher than any other EU country, and well above the worldwide average of $290.</p>
<p>Portugal’s high rate of gambling may be due in part to its struggling economy. With unemployment at over 15%, many Portuguese people may be looking for ways to make money. Gambling can be seen as a relatively easy way to make a quick profit, especially considering that the odds are usually in favor of the house.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why gambling can be addictive, and Portugal is not alone in seeing increased spending on gambling. In the United States, for example, nearly two-thirds of adults report having gambled in some form in the past year. And while most people who gamble do so without any problems, for some it can become a serious addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on individuals and families. It can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships and even job loss. And it’s not just the people who are addicted who suffer; their loved ones often have to pick up the pieces when things fall apart.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are many support groups available both online and in person, and there are also counsellors who specialize in helping people overcome addictions to gambling. Don’t be afraid to ask for help; it’s never too late to get your life back on track.</p>
