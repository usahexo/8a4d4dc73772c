        <h1 id="I-Lost-30-000-in-5-Years-Before-I-Quit-Gambling"><a href="#I-Lost-30-000-in-5-Years-Before-I-Quit-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="I Lost $30,000 in 5 Years Before I Quit Gambling"></a>I Lost $30,000 in 5 Years Before I Quit Gambling</h1><h3 id="The-Start"><a href="#The-Start" class="headerlink" title="The Start"></a>The Start</h3><p>I first started gambling when I was just 19 years old. It was the summer before my sophomore year of college and I had just cashed a check from my summer job. A friend of mine had invited me to the casino with him and I decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>I remember feeling so excited as we pulled up to the casino. We went inside and I immediately started playing the slot machines. Within minutes, I had lost my entire paycheck. I was so embarrassed that I didn’t want to tell my friend how much money I had lost.</p>
<p>I vowed that I would never gamble again, but the next week, I found myself back at the casino. This time, I didn’t lose quite as much money but it was only a matter of time before I lost big. Over the next few years, I would visit the casino every weekend and lose anywhere from $100 to $1,000 each time.</p>
<p>The casinos were like a drug to me and I couldn’t resist their lure no matter how much money I lost. In total, over the course of 5 years, I lost $30,000 gambling.</p>
<h3 id="The-Turning-Point"><a href="#The-Turning-Point" class="headerlink" title="The Turning Point"></a>The Turning Point</h3><p>The final straw came one weekend when I had lost almost my entire paycheck for the month. It was then that I realized that gambling was costing me not just money but also happiness and peace of mind.</p>
<p>I knew that if I didn’t quit gambling then, I would lose even more money and eventually go into debt. So, I made the decision to quit gambling for good and thankfully, it has been over 5 years since the last time I visited a casino.</p>
<p>Gambling can be incredibly addictive and destructive so it’s important to be aware of the risks before you start playing. If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, please reach out for help. There are many resources available for people who want to overcome their addiction.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-do-Addicts-Lose-Prior-to-Quitting-Gambling"><a href="#How-Much-Money-do-Addicts-Lose-Prior-to-Quitting-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money do Addicts Lose Prior to Quitting Gambling?"></a>How Much Money do Addicts Lose Prior to Quitting Gambling?</h1><p>The first step in solving any problem is understanding its magnitude. The same is true when it comes to gambling addiction where the first step is quantifying the losses incurred by addicts before they quit.</p>
<p>A study by the National Center for Responsible Gaming (NCRG) found that problem and pathological gamblers lose an average of $74,000 and $184,000 respectively in a seven-year period prior to quitting. This is a staggering amount of money that could have been used for other productive purposes such as savings, investments or even paying off debts.</p>
<p>In fact, the total economic cost of gambling addiction was estimated at $5.77 billion in 2015 according to the Council on Problem Gambling (CPG). This figure includes direct costs such as medical expenses and indirect costs such as lost productivity.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have serious consequences not just for the addict but also their loved ones. Families are often forced to bear the brunt of the financial consequences arising from gambling addiction. For instance, they may need to take on additional jobs or sell assets to help pay off debts accrued by the addict.</p>
<p>Addicts tend to gamble more when they are experiencing financial difficulties as they hope to win back what they have lost. This only leads to more losses and further financial hardship for both the addict and their family.</p>
<p>It is important for family members and friends of addicts to understand the magnitude of the problem so that they can provide support in getting the addict help. Addicts must also be willing to seek help if they want to overcome their addiction. Treatment options available include counselling and medication-assisted treatment.</p>

<p>Many people develop a gambling addiction. This means they cannot control their urge to gamble and they end up losing a lot of money. In fact, gambling addicts lose an average of $5500 every year! That’s a lot of money that could have been used for things like food, clothing, or housing.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, it is important to get help right away. There are many treatment options available, including counseling and medication. With the right treatment, gambling addicts can learn how to control their addiction and start rebuilding their lives.</p>
