#  How To Revoke Online Casino Self Exclusion PragmaticPlay In Less Than A Minute!

In this short, but detailed guide, we will be walking you through the steps required to revoke your self exclusion from an online casino. This process can be completed in under a minute, and is something that all players should be aware of.

1 Firstly, you will need to access the casino’s website and locate the self exclusion area. This can typically be found under the responsible gambling section of the website.

2 Once you have located the self exclusion area, you will need to enter your personal details, including your name and date of birth.

3 Next, you will need to select the reason for your self exclusion. You will then be asked to confirm that you want to exclude yourself from the casino.

4 Finally, you will be given a confirmation code. This code must be kept safe, as you will need it to reactivate your account at a later stage.

That’s all there is to it! Following these simple steps will ensure that you are no longer able to access your online casino account. If you ever change your mind and want to return to playing at the casino, simply follow these same steps and enter the confirmation code that was provided to you.

#  How To Automatically Revoke Online Casino Self Exclusion PragmaticPlay

There are a number of measures that can be put in place to help minimise the risk of gambling harm, one of which is self-exclusion. This is where a person voluntarily chooses to stop themselves from gambling, either temporarily or permanently.

online casino self exclusion can be a great way to protect yourself from harming your finances and your mental health, but what happens if you decide you want to start gambling again? In this article, we’ll show you how to automatically revoke online casino self exclusion so that you can start enjoying gambling again without any hassle.

The first thing you need to do is find an online casino that supports automatic self-exclusion revocation. PragmaticPlay is a good example of an online casino that offers this feature. Once you’ve found a casino that meets your needs, create an account and head to the settings page.

Under the “Automatic Self-Exclusion Revocation” section, tick the box next to “Enable” and enter the date on which you want the self-exclusion to end. Click “Save Changes” and you’re done!

Now, when the date specified arrives, the self-exclusion will automatically be cancelled and you will be able to log in and start gambling again. Keep in mind that casinos usually have a cooling off period after revocation, so make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully before starting to gamble again.
