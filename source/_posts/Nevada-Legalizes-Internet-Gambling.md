#  Nevada Legalizes Internet Gambling

In a unanimous decision on Tuesday, the Nevada State Assembly voted to legalize internet gambling. The bill, which was sponsored by assemblyman Jason Frierson, now heads to the Senate for approval. If it passes there, it will go to Governor Brian Sandoval for his signature.

Nevada is the first state in the nation to legalize internet gambling, but it's likely not the last. Several other states are also considering similar measures, including New Jersey, California and Illinois.

The main benefit of legalizing internet gambling is that it will allow casinos to reach out to a larger customer base. Currently, most casino customers are residents of Nevada or neighboring states like California and Arizona. With online gambling, casinos can attract players from all over the country (and world).

Online gambling also offers some advantages over traditional casino gaming. It's cheaper - players can place bets for as little as a penny - and there's no need to leave home or travel to a casino. In addition, online gambling offers more variety than traditional casinos, with games like blackjack, roulette and poker available around the clock.

There are some concerns about online gambling, including addiction and underage gambling. However, supporters argue that these problems already exist in traditional casinos and that legalizing internet gambling will help to address them.

Whether you're in favor of or against legalized internet gambling, one thing is certain: it's here to stay. Sooner or later, every state is going to have to make a decision about whether or not to legalize it.

#  Nevada Becomes First State to Legalize Internet Gambling

On Tuesday, the Nevada state assembly voted unanimously to legalize internet gambling, making it the first US state to do so. The bill now goes to the Senate for a vote, but is expected to pass.

Governor Brian Sandoval has said he will sign the bill into law when it reaches his desk.

Internet gambling is currently illegal in most of the United States, with New Jersey being the only other state to have legalized it.

Under the Nevada bill, online poker operators would be able to apply for licenses from the state gaming control board. Operators would be required to partner with a land-based casino in order to offer their games.

Supporters of the bill say that it will help Nevada's struggling casinos, which have been hurt by competition from neighboring states that have more lenient gambling laws.

Opponents of internet gambling argue that it is too risky and can be addictive.

It’s been a long time coming, but as of September 1st, online gambling is now legal in Nevada. Governor Brian Sandoval singed the bill into law on June 10th, paving the way for a new era in Sin City.

Nevada has always been at the forefront of gambling innovation, and this latest development is no exception. The move is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state, as well as create thousands of jobs.

Online gambling has been growing in popularity all over the world, and Nevada is eager to get in on the action. There are already dozens of casinos operating in the state, and many more are expected to open up their own online platforms in the coming months.

There are a wide variety of games that can be played online, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. Players can also place bets on sports events, making it possible to combine two of America’s favorite pastimes into one exciting experience.

Other states are now taking notice and considering similar measures. This is largely due to the success that Nevada has had in attracting players and businesses to its market.
