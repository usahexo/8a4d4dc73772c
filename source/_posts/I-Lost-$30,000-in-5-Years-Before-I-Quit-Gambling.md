#  I Lost $30,000 in 5 Years Before I Quit Gambling

### The Start

I first started gambling when I was just 19 years old. It was the summer before my sophomore year of college and I had just cashed a check from my summer job. A friend of mine had invited me to the casino with him and I decided to give it a try.

I remember feeling so excited as we pulled up to the casino. We went inside and I immediately started playing the slot machines. Within minutes, I had lost my entire paycheck. I was so embarrassed that I didn't want to tell my friend how much money I had lost.

I vowed that I would never gamble again, but the next week, I found myself back at the casino. This time, I didn't lose quite as much money but it was only a matter of time before I lost big. Over the next few years, I would visit the casino every weekend and lose anywhere from $100 to $1,000 each time.

The casinos were like a drug to me and I couldn't resist their lure no matter how much money I lost. In total, over the course of 5 years, I lost $30,000 gambling.

### The Turning Point

The final straw came one weekend when I had lost almost my entire paycheck for the month. It was then that I realized that gambling was costing me not just money but also happiness and peace of mind.

I knew that if I didn't quit gambling then, I would lose even more money and eventually go into debt. So, I made the decision to quit gambling for good and thankfully, it has been over 5 years since the last time I visited a casino.

Gambling can be incredibly addictive and destructive so it's important to be aware of the risks before you start playing. If you are struggling with a gambling addiction, please reach out for help. There are many resources available for people who want to overcome their addiction.

In fact, the total economic cost of gambling addiction was estimated at $5.77 billion in 2015 according to the Council on Problem Gambling (CPG). This figure includes direct costs such as medical expenses and indirect costs such as lost productivity.

Families are often forced to bear the brunt of the financial consequences arising from gambling addiction.
